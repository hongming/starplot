# Translations

This folder contains the raw data that'll be used in translating text in Starplot to other languages, including:

- Star names
- DSO names
- Constellation names (IAU-recognized constellations only, different constellations will be handled as part of sky cultures)
- Planet names
- Sun/moon
- Other terms (e.g. cardinal directions, etc)

The format of each file should be pretty self-explanatory, but here's a reference of the column names:

- `hip_id` = Hipparcos ID of a star
- `open_ngc_name` = Name of a DSO (as designated in OpenNGC)
- `iau_id` = Three letter IAU abbreviation of a constellation

If you're interested in helping with these translations, please open a PR with updates to these files.

This is still a work in progress. Translations are not expected to be implemented until Starplot `v0.17.0`

Thanks for your help!
